tips and tricks:

bluetooth pairing:
flash the reset firmware on ALL devices to ensure they can pair to each other

if we suppose the KEY is:

LEFT_HAND           RIGHT_HAND
    T1 T2           T1 T2

to get the menu when booting the computer to select boot device: F11 -> T2 + leftmost key on middle row, left hand
bluetooth pair: 
LT2 + RT1 -> bluetooth layer
          + rightmost key on upper row, left hand: bluetooth reset
          + any other key on upper row: pick that bluetooth profile
