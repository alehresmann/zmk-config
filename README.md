nFRConnect -> programmer app on windows to flash the device

generate the .uf2 with github actions

convert to hex / bin / whatever with the build_dfu.sh script

rn its generating malformed .hex files (which nRFConnect expects) with no registers. check chatgpt (home comp) hat "shield not found error" for debugging
